Coin Changer Kata
=========

## Overview
If you need change, this coin changer will make sure you get the most efficient set of coins. For instance, if you need 89 cents, then this coin changer will give you 3 quarters, 1 dime and 4 pennies or "QQQDPPPP".

This was written to practice TDD with Ruby and Rspec. 

To see that it passes a variety of tests, type this into the command line:

    rspec coin_changer_spec.rb
